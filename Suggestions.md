- Try to avoid using magic variables.
-  Please adjust your code to match PEP8 for spacing, line lengths, and function naming.
-  Consider using functools.total_ordering. This would allow you to only implement __eq__ and __lt__, reducing code duplication.
- Your tests provided are good, but consider adding more edge cases (e.g., both versions with pre-release, missing pre-release, etc. ).
  For future work, consider using unittest or pytest for more formal testing.
